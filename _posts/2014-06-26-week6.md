I had to pass my exams as quickly as possible and so did I.
I am two days in my examination period and I am already done!

###KCSD2D
----------
The two dimensional variant of KCSD works.
A sample reconstruction looks like this:

~~~python
In [1]: from pykCSD.pykCSD import KCSD
In [2]: import numpy as np
In [3]: elec_pos = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1,0], [1,1], [0.5,0.5]])
In [4]: pots = np.array([0,0,0,0,1])
In [5]: k = KCSD(elec_pos, pots, params={'x_min': -2, 'x_max': 2, 'y_min':-2, 'y_max':2})
In [6]: k.estimate_pots()
In [7]: k.estimate_csd()
In [8]: k.plot_all()
~~~

The current limitations are similar as in the KCSD1D case (no time recordings reconstruction and whole data in RAM) which will be worked upon.

###Midterm evaluation
----------
The first part of Google Summer of Code passed so rapidly I barely noticed the midterm evaluation! Passed! :)

> Hi Grzegorz Parka,

> We have processed the evaluation for your project named Object Oriented Python Kernel Current Source Density toolbox with International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility.
> 
> Congratulations, from our data it seems that you have successfully passed the Google Summer of Code 2014 - Midterm Evaluation. Please contact your mentor to discuss the results of your evaluation and to plan your goals and development plan for the rest of the program
> 
> Greetings,
> The Google Open Source Programs Team

Actually I'm on the right track following the schedule from my proposal.

###Bonus from Google and ACM
There is an additional surprise for us, GSoC students :)

> Hi GSoC 2014 students,

> The ACM has offered to give you all ACM Student Memberships with
> Digital Library access (which is the benefits of student membership
> plus access to the ACM Digital Library, an electronic subscription to
> both CACM and XRDS) this year. We will be issuing these memberships to
> you starting 14 July. You will receive an email directly from the ACM

This is like one of the most useful gifts I've been given in years! I love reading scientific articles! :D

###Next step
----------
Now when I have the 1D and 2D cases working, it's time to implement the 3D case. This time no dimension is missing so the relation between sources and potentials becomes simply:

$$ \phi(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \sigma}\iiint \frac{dx' dy' dz' C(x',y',z')}{\sqrt{(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+(z-z')^2}} $$

The size of basis source matrices may now become an issue. We will find out soon!

Also expect some 3D plots soon!
