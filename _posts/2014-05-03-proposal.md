I am very happy to announce that my proposal[^1] has been accepted by the members of INCF and I will work on Python Object Oriented Kernel Current Source Density Toolbox project during this summer.

The goal of the project is to implement the recently developed Kernel Current Source Density method using an open and scientist-friendly stack -- Python, Numpy and Scipy. 

This is going to be a great summer!
