We are now in the begining of the coding period. I will use this week to create the common interface for accessing the kCSD solvers for different dimensionality. It is a kind of stub that will be useful later and will help to create a clean and consistent interface.

This doesn't take whole week and leaves some time for more challenging activities, such as exploring the kCSD method deeper.
