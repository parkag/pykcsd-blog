###TL;DR: - basic version of KCSD3D works, [KCSD3D images](#plotting)

During the implementation of the 3D version of kCSD, there were few things to consider:

###Distribution of sources in 2D and 3D
Problem: having approx $$n_{src}$$ sources we need to distribute them evenly in 3D space.

The approach proposed for two dimensions in kCSD 2D seems a bit unclear for me:

	def get_src_params_2D(Lx, Ly, n_src):   
    	coeff = [Ly, Lx - Ly, -Lx * n_src];

    	rts = np.roots(coeff)
    	r = [r for r in rts if type(r) is not complex and r > 0]
    
    	nx = r[0]
    	ny = n_src/nx

    	ds = Lx/(nx-1)

    	nx = np.floor(nx) + 1
    	ny = np.floor(ny) + 1

    	Lx_n = (nx - 1) * ds
    	Ly_n = (ny - 1) * ds

    	return (nx, ny, Lx_n, Ly_n, ds)

which for enables to distribute sources like this:

	<figcaption>old approach using roots</figcaption>
</figure>

with such parameters:

	(nx=6.0, ny=4.0, Lx_n=3.8359071790069814, Ly_n=2.301544307404189, ds=0.76718143580139631)

I have no idea how to extend this into higher dimension.

**My approach** is to divide the area/volume into $$n_{src}$$ parts (squares) 
and then calculate the side of each square and number of squares for each axis:

	def get_src_params_2D_new(Lx, Ly, n_src):
    	S = Lx*Ly
    	S_unit = float(S)/n_src
    	nx = np.ceil(Lx*S_unit**(-1./2))
    	ny = np.ceil(Ly*S_unit**(-1./2))
    
    	ds = Lx/nx
    
    	Lx_n = (nx)*ds
    	Ly_n = (ny)*ds
    
    	return (nx, ny, Lx_n, Ly_n, ds)

for the same input as in the previous approach it gives slightly different results:

	(nx=6.0, ny=4.0, Lx_n=3.2000000000000002, Ly_n=2.1333333333333333, ds=0.53333333333333333)

This scales well from 2D to 3D (and further), since it's based on the conception of (hyper)volume.

###Potential
The potential is obviously just:

$$ \phi(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \sigma} \iiint \frac{C(x',y',z') dx' dy' dz'}{\sqrt{(x-x')+(y-y')+(z-z')}}$$

and $$C(x,y,z)$$ may be for example a 3D step function:
 $$C(x,y,z) = \begin{cases}
										1, & \text{if }x^2+y^2+z^2 < R^2 \\
										0, & \text{ otherwise}
									\end{cases} $$

which can be imagined as a sphere of uniform density.

or gaussian function:

$$C(x,y,z) = \exp \left(-\frac{(x - \mu_x)^2 + (y - \mu_y)^2 + (z - \mu_z)^2}{2\sigma ^2} \right) $$

which can be imagined as a sphere getting denser and denser near its core. 

Calculated at different distances, the function may look like this:

###Memory issues
The main matrices used in the kCSD method may become large enough to use whole RAM, let's investigate them:

* dist_table - O(1), typically 100x1
	* this is small and memory-safe
* b_pot_matrix - $$O(n_{src} \cdot n_{elec})$$ 
	* grows fast with number of sources and number of electrodes
	* we can suppose this is safe while $$n_{elec} < 1000$$, $$n_{src} < 1000$$ (rarely violated)
* b_interp_pot_matrix - $$O(n_{voxels} \cdot n_{src})$$
	* size grows rapidly with output sampling quality and number of sources 
	* safe as long as the number of voxels (volume units) $$n_{voxels} < 1000000$$ (100x100x100) which may not be met for more detailed reconstructions
* b_src_matrix - $$O(n_{voxels} \cdot n_{src})$$
	* as in b_interp_pot_matrix
	* size could be reduced if the basis functions are axis-symmetric, but not in general.

* estimated_pots, estimated_csd - $$O(n_{voxels} \cdot n_{timeframe})$$ 
	* size grows rapidly with output sampling quality and number of time records.
	* with more than few timeframes, these matrices are impossible to hold in RAM and must be stored on HDD



###Plotting
There are few possibilites to visualize 3D data obtained from KCSD.

####Matplotlib
Matplotlib is designed to visualize 2D data and its 3D features are very limited.
We can only visualize electrode positions in 3D as a cloud of points. Potentials and CSD can be presented as slices through chosen axes.

####Mayavi
Using mayavi, there are more possibilities:

Plane cuts:

	pots = k.estimated_pots
	mlab.pipeline.image_plane_widget(mlab.pipeline.scalar_field(pots),
					plane_orientation='x_axes',
					slice_index=10,
					)
	mlab.pipeline.image_plane_widget(mlab.pipeline.scalar_field(pots),
					plane_orientation='y_axes',
					slice_index=10,
					)
	mlab.outline()

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/kcsd3d_1.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/kcsd3d_1.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Looks fine, the planes can be adjusted interactively.</figcaption>
</figure>

Volumetric plot:

	mlab.pipeline.volume(mlab.pipeline.scalar_field(pots))
	mlab.outline()

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/volumetric1.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/volumetric1.png"></a>
	<figcaption>May be a bit unclear with all the data displayed.</figcaption>
</figure>

	mlab.pipeline.volume(mlab.pipeline.scalar_field(pots), 
				vmin=pots.min()+0.2*pots.ptp(), 
				vmax=pots.max()-0.2*pots.ptp())
	mlab.outline()

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/volumetric2.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/volumetric2.png"></a>
	<figcaption>It may be convenient to display only lower 20 and upper 20 percentiles of the data</figcaption>
</figure>

Combined iso-surface and plane cut

	s_pots = mlab.pipeline.scalar_field(pots)
	mlab.pipeline.iso_surface(s_pots, contours=[pots.min()+0.1*pots.ptp(), ], opacity=0.1)
	mlab.pipeline.iso_surface(s_pots, contours=[pots.max()-0.1*pots.ptp(), ],)
	mlab.pipeline.image_plane_widget(s_pots,
					plane_orientation='z_axes',
					slice_index=10,
					)
	mlab.outline()

<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/combined.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/combined.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Combined approach</figcaption>
</figure>

PS. to avoid freezes in mayavi.mlab 3D visualizer a proper gui should be used:

	%gui wx

####External plotter - Paraview
Paraview is a library built for data analysis and visualization. It's optimized to work with big datasets. Worth a try!

### What's next?
Now that the basic versions of KCSD in 1D, 2D, 3D are implemented, there are few things to manage:

* Refactoring
	* improving readability
	* reducing code redundancy - each KCSD class is based on the same template. It would be nice to merge them, but only if the code stays readable. 
	* static functions will be moved to appropriate modules (say: source_templates, source_management, model_potential, cross_validation)

* managing big datasets - some matrices should be read from HDD dynamically and not kept in RAM all the time
	* check np.memmap and hdf5 data format
* investigate how much speedup can be achieved
	* especially: fix the n-dimensional integrals (numpy warns they don't converge fast enough), especially if we use step basis
* more tests, better documentation

After managing this, the package will be ready to be deployed.
