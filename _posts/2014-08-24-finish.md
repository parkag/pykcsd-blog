The coding phase of Google Summer of Code 2014 is over. So there come the results of final evaluation.

### Final evaluation

I'm really happy about!

### Further development

Of course it is not the end of pykCSD project. I've just programmed a working alfa version during this summer. The skills that I developed during the project will be further used to maintain and even extend the package.

Also it's a pleasure to work with Daniel :)
