During this week I am still working on KCSD2D and passing exams at the Uni.

There was a funny problem, which took me a while to find, different type casting in Matlab and Python:

Python:

	np.uint16(0.1)
	>> 0
	np.uint16(0.6)
	>> 0

Matlab:

	uint16(0.1)
	>> 0
	uint16(0.6)
	>> 1

This means that ```uint16(x)``` from Matlab may be translated to Python as ```np.uint16(round(x))``` obviously. It took me a while to find it out though.
