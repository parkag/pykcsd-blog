During this week I am working on the kCSD implementation that works with data from measurements made by electrodes organized in lines.

Meanwhile I would like to tell what I learnt about regularization and cross validation in the context of regression.
This is summed up in [this notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/parkag/notebooks/blob/master/pykCSD/RLS%20and%20cross%20validation.ipynb). This is a nice introduction to machine learning :)

I am still writing the pykCSD in IPython notebook and my current progress can be tracked [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/parkag/notebooks/blob/master/pykCSD/pykCSD%20refactored.ipynb). This version will soon become obsolete as it will be reorganized and moved to the proper python source files in INCF/pykCSD repo.
